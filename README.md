# Minimum-Spanning-Tree

This function will find the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's algorithm and returns a list of edges that represents a minimum spanning tree. Each element in the list of edges is made up of a tuple of two vertices

For example, given this graph:

The function wwill return a list with the following edges:

[(2, 3), (5, 6), (0, 1), (3, 4), (0, 2), (4, 5)] which represents the MST in this picture
